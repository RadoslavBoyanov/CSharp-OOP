# C# OOP
 The "C# OOP" course teaches the principles of object-oriented object-oriented programming (OOP), learns to work with classes and classes, to use object-oriented modeling, and to build class hierarchies. I was taught the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. I was introduced to the design patterns used (creative, structural and behavioral design patterns). Introduces me to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. Explores various debugging techniques. Shows me how to create and use decorators. Focuses on component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
Skills I have acquired
- Understanding the object-oriented programming paradigm
- Application of the principles of object-oriented programming
- Creating a class hierarchy and inheritance
- Using the Reflection API
- Data encapsulation
