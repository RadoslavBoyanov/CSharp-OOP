# CSharp OOP
 The "C# OOP" course teaches the principles of object-oriented object-oriented programming (OOP), learns to work with classes and classes, to use object-oriented modeling, and to build class hierarchies. I was taught the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. I was introduced to the design patterns used (creative, structural and behavioral design patterns). Introduces me to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. Explores various debugging techniques. Shows me how to create and use decorators. Focuses on component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
